# Claude Execution Control — Sognos React

## 1. Project Understanding

### What Sognos Is
Sognos is an **AI-powered service operations platform** built on Microsoft Dynamics 365. It enables organisations to deliver services efficiently, coordinate complex workforces, and maintain compliance.

**Positioning:** Product-led SaaS platform. NOT a consulting or Microsoft partner site.

### Product System

| Product | Role |
|---------|------|
| **SognosCare** | Care operations & compliance — case management, service delivery tracking, compliance & reporting |
| **SognosRoster** | Workforce scheduling & optimisation — staff allocation, scheduling & routing, real-time optimisation |
| **Sognos Genogram** | Relationship & family context mapping — embeds support networks, histories, and family structures into case records |

**Relationship:** SognosCare manages services. SognosRoster coordinates the workforce that delivers them. Sognos Genogram enriches case records with relational context. All three are standalone — they can be implemented independently or together.

### Architecture Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Products** | Primary positioning | SognosCare, SognosRoster, Sognos Genogram |
| **Solutions** | Supporting engagements | Field Service, CRM, Customer Insights, Customer Experience, Customer Service, Power Platform, Quick Start |
| **Industries** | Sector entry points | Health & Social Care, Facilities Management, Local Government, Industrial Services, Energy & Utilities |
| **Platform** | Embedded proof only — never top-level | Dynamics 365, Copilot AI, Power Platform |

### Core Objective
Transform Sognos from a Microsoft partner / consulting website into a **product-led platform company** — Stripe/Luno quality, SaaS-level UX, conversion-focused.

## 7. Design System (Approved — Phase 6)

- **Headings:** Inter Tight, weight 400 default
- **Body:** Inter
- **Cards:** card tokens, no gradients on standard cards or subcards
- **Radius:** sm 4px / md 8px / lg 12px / xl 16px / 2xl 20px / full 9999px
- **Gradients:** hero and deliberate highlight surfaces only
- **Container:** `max-w-7xl`
- **Components:** Server Components by default; Client Components only when interaction is required

---

## 8. Current Task

**Phase 6 — Design System Application**

Company pages complete. Contact page live. Knowledge Hub live.

Pending:
- [ ] `/customers` hub + `/customers/[slug]` — referenced by CustomerStories and nav
- [ ] Phase 6 — design system pass across all pages

---

## 9. Next Tasks (Ordered)

1. Build customers hub and case study pages (`/customers`, `/customers/[slug]`)
2. Phase 6 — design system application pass
3. Phase 7 — UI polish and motion

---

## 10. Technical Gotchas

- **Linter strips code between saves** — always re-read file before multi-step edits; bento overlay was removed twice by the formatter
- **Card backgrounds** — never use `style={{ background: "" }}`; use `bg-white` class. Empty string = transparent card = orbs invisible
- **FlyonUI is NOT installed** — when user pastes FlyonUI snippets, translate to React state + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- **Component reference sources** — Aceternity UI and Magic UI are the preferred sources for animated bento/card components; do not hand-build from Stripe HTML
- **Interactive sections** — any section using useState/hooks needs `"use client"` at the top; ProductSection is already a client component
- **`@property --shine-angle`** — requires Chrome 85+ / Safari 15.4+; see globals.css for full shine border implementation
- **Framer Motion drawer pattern** — established in ProductSection: `AnimatePresence` wraps conditional render, outer `motion.div` fades, inner panel uses `y: "100%" → 0` spring (`damping: 30, stiffness: 300`)

---

## Hard Rules

- Products are primary — always lead with SognosCare + SognosRoster
- Solutions are supporting — never primary positioning
- Industries are separate from solutions — never merge
- Platform is embedded proof only — never a nav item, never a standalone page layer
- CTA label: **"Book a Demo"** everywhere
- Doc sync: any routing, permalink, or page title change must update `project-overview.md` and `project-plan.md` in the same task
- Server Components by default
- No styling decisions until Phase 6
- Claude = Builder + Architect only (NOT designer)
