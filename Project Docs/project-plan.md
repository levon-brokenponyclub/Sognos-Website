# Sognos Website — Project Plan

> Alignment note: Updated during the architecture-alignment pass to remove legacy scaffold instructions and reflect the current implementation phase and approved content layers.

## Current Status

Phases 1–5b complete. 27 routes live and statically generated.

Also complete outside the original phase plan:
- `/contact` page — built and live
- `/knowledge-hub` — renamed from `/resources`, includes KnowledgeHubArchive with sticky filters + 6 real articles
- Homepage polish: LogoStrip → infinite CSS marquee, ProofSection bento grid with video/image bg tiles, IndustrySection always-on video, SolutionsSection dark bg, CustomerStories trimmed to 3 active

Immediate focus:
- Phase 6 — design system application pass (in progress, started 2026-05-01)
- `/customers` hub + `/customers/[slug]` — referenced by CustomerStories and nav
